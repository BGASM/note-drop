                            <p>Everyone learns and takes notes differently. I don't think that there is a one-size-fits-all best note-taking style - but I do think there are more efficient strategies that may be applied to all styles. I bet you a coke that there are statistically relevant associations between note-taking best-practices and academic performance.</p>
                            <p>My interest is in finding patterns that (may) exist in the note-taking habits of academically-proficient medical students. At this time I am not attaching a survey to the note submission, because I have no fucking clue what to ask (my research begins and ends at videotaping dolphins). But, if this works and I am able to create some models from the notes submitted, I would be interested in trying to get some academia up in this.</p>
